# TechWorks Consulting Employee Salary Prediction

## Introduction
TechWorks Consulting Employee Salary Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to predict the salaries of newly hired employees at TechWorks Consulting. This project leverages data analysis and regression modeling to determine fair and competitive compensation for employees based on various factors.

## Problem Statement
TechWorks Consulting is known for efficiently matching skilled IT professionals with job opportunities. To maintain its success, the company needs a data-driven approach to determine employee salaries. The problem statement is to create a machine learning model that predicts the salary of newly hired employees using available data, considering factors such as education, experience, role, and more.

## Approach
To tackle this problem, we follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Convert categorical data, handle missing values, and outliers, and prepare the data for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data distributions and analyze feature correlations.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose regression models for predicting salaries.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train and evaluate models, select the best-performing model.
5. **Model Interpretation**: Understand the importance of features in the selected model.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning (if needed)**: Fine-tune model parameters for better performance.
7. **Final Model Deployment (optional)**: Deploy the model for salary prediction.

## Data
The dataset includes information about employees, including features such as college tier, city type, role, previous CTC, job change, graduation marks, experience, and current CTC. Data preprocessing is performed to make it suitable for machine learning.

## Available ML Model Options
Several regression models can be considered for this task, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and more. The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.

## Model Performance
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The model with the lowest error is chosen as the final model.
